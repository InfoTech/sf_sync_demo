== Salesforce Sync Demo
This demo app demonstrates a basic use of the salesforce_ar_sync gem. It is setup to be deployed to Heroku. To try it out you will need a Salesforce sandbox, and somewhere to deploy the app.

Clone the application, copy the example yml files in the config directory substituting your own credentials and Organization Id.
